Life is full of confusing and disordering Particular time
a particular location,Do the arranged thing of ten million time in the brain,Step by step
the life is hard to avoid delicacy and stiffness No enthusiasm forever
No unexpected happening of surprising and pleasing So
only silently ask myself in mind Next happiness,when will come?
Dark light,just light each other.
The responsibility that you and my shoulders take together,
the such as one dust covers up.
Afraid only afraid the light is suddenly put out in theendless dark night and Countless loneliness
don't know what I do now is right, those are wrong,
and when I finally Laosi when I know these.
So I can do now is to try to do well in everything,
and then wait to die a natural death.
Sometimes I can be very happy to talk to everyone,
can be very presumptuous, but no one knows,
it is but very deliberatelycamouflage,
camouflage; I can make him very happy very happy,
but couldn't find the source of happiness, just giggle
